Around 20,700 [volunteers](http://www.redcross.org.au/volunteering.aspx) brought their diverse skills and energy to our services and supported [Red Cross Shops](http://www.redcross.org.au/stores.aspx) and administrative functions. Many volunteers showed their extraordinary dedication by choosing to spend Christmas 2015 in evacuation centres, supporting communities in the NT and Victoria who were facing floods and fires. We want our volunteers to reflect the full diversity of Australian society, and in the coming year we'll continue reaching out to welcome Indigenous volunteers, people living with disability, and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. 16% of our volunteers this year were under the age of 30*; next year we'd like to welcome a larger cohort of young people to support their communities through Red Cross.

<p><small><i>Age was unknown for 15% of volunteers, so actual proportion may be higher.</i></small></p>
