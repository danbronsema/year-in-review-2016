Our aid workers were on the frontlines of major crises around the world. They helped restore water supplies for families in Syria, organised emergency shelter for those who lost homes to Cyclone Winston in Fiji, coordinated volunteer teams to help migrants arriving in Greece, and cared for the last patients of the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone. They are expert specialists in various areas, carefully selected for their challenging jobs and supported in the field.

Several aid workers also gave their time to our [How Aid Works podcast](http://www.redcross.org.au/how-aid-works---podcast.aspx), providing listeners with rare and honest insights into the world of humanitarian aid.
