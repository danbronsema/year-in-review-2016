Support from trusts and foundations totalled more than $2.4 million, while support from private ancillary funds saw a 29% rise this year. 

Generous grants and gifts were received for pilot projects and the continuation of key services. For example, John T Reid Charitable Trusts are enabling a two-year pilot of the Irish Prison Service's successful CommunityBased Health and First Aid program at Townsville Correctional Facility; while an almost $950,000 grant from Perpetual will support evaluative research of this pilot as well as other sites running the program.
