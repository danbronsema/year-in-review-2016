Our ambassadors built positive engagement with our work through their personal networks and appearances on behalf of Red Cross. Dr Munjed Al Muderis donated his time to multiple events including World Red Cross Day celebrations and our community event to launch SBS' Go Back To Where You Came From series, while his profile increased over the year due to several positive media stories on his refugee journey and ground-breaking work as a surgeon. Chris Bath and Bob Handby travelled to Timor-Leste to raise awareness of the importance and benefits of clean water and sanitation, with Chris' story on the trip leading directly to a $30,000 donation towards clean water in Timor-Leste.

*We thank the following people for their support as Red Cross ambassadors this year:*

Patron: His Excellency General the Honourable Sir Pete Cosgrove AK MC (Retd)
