We are proud to work with the business community to support the most vulnerable people in Australia and overseas. Not confined solely to financial support, the benefits of these partnerships extend to in-kind support, corporate volunteering and participation in fundraising campaigns. Increasingly we hope to develop partnerships with both financial and nonfinancial outcomes.

Our partners include ALDI, who this year joined forces with us to promote access to sufficient, affordable and healthy food. The partnership is a multi-year agreement that involves a minimum commitment of $300,000 every year, enabling people to gain the knowledge and skills to provide healthy meals for themselves and their family, manage household food budgets and add healthy eating into their overall lifestyle. We look forward to increased outcomes with the support of Insurance Australia Group Limited, who recently provided $1.2 million in funding for the coming years.
