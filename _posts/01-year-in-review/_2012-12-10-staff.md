More than 2,300 staff served as the backbone of our services and operations. At the close of the financial year, our staff were 72% female and 28% male; this remains unchanged from last year. We are proud that 21% of our staff are young people under 30 and 7.7% are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander†.
