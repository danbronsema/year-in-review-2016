We are grateful to over 229 workplace giving partners and their employees who this year contributed more than $1.1 million to our work. Through workplace giving we receive funding not just from individual employees who contribute regular donations through their pre-tax pay, but also from many employers who choose to match their employees' contributions.

*We would like to acknowledge our top 10 workplace giving partners, who contribute 40% of our total income in this area:*
